% hg = heat transfer coefficient of gas 
% hl = heat transfer coefficient of liquid
% tw = wall thickness (m)
% t = time (s)
% mu = viscosity 
% Pr = prandtl number
% cp = heat capacity 
% k = thermal conductivity 
% Dc = Chamber Diameter (m)
% Dt = Throat diameter (m)
% Dh = hydraulic diameter (m)
% rho = density (kg/m^3)
% v = velocity (m/s)
